# Custom Pivot Looker Studio Visualization

This is a Looker studio community visualization that allows you to create pivot tables with a lot of additional features not in the built in pivot tables.

It is limited though, because it's a true community visualisation, so it has a fundemental limitation in that it is not linked to the raw data. So Distinct counts can't be pushed into subtotals.

## Installation

1.  In Looker Studio, click on the button next to the the "Add a chart button" (the Community Visualisastions button)
2.  Click on "+Explore more"
3.  Click on "Build your own visualisation".
4.  In the Manifest path\* field, enter `gs://custompivot/custompivotlookervis` as the path to the community vis.
5.  Click "Submit"
